# Resume Bullet Points

## Option 1: Technical Focus

• Developed a real-time keyword spotting system using PyTorch with 2D CNN architecture, achieving 70-85% validation accuracy on binary classification ("hello" vs "unknown") with models under 2MB optimized for edge deployment on ESP32 microcontrollers

• Implemented aggressive data augmentation pipeline (noise injection, pitch/time shifting, spectral filtering) and class imbalance handling (automatic oversampling, weighted focal loss), increasing effective dataset size 10x from 20 audio samples to 1,600+ training variants per epoch

## Option 2: Impact Focus

• Built end-to-end machine learning pipeline for real-time audio keyword detection, from data collection and preprocessing (MFCC feature extraction) through model training (with early stopping and regularization) to deployment-ready inference with GUI and CLI interfaces

• Engineered lightweight deep learning models (<2MB) for embedded systems using depthwise separable convolutions, achieving sub-10ms inference latency with 85%+ training accuracy while implementing robust false-positive reduction through sliding window averaging and temporal smoothing techniques

## Option 3: Concise Technical

• Designed and deployed a PyTorch-based real-time keyword spotting system with 2D CNN architecture, achieving 70-85% validation accuracy on binary audio classification with models <2MB for edge device deployment

• Architected data augmentation pipeline with 7 transformation techniques (noise, pitch shift, time stretch, filtering) and automatic class balancing, expanding 20-sample dataset to 1,600+ variants per epoch while reducing overfitting through dropout regularization and early stopping

## Option 4: Skills Highlight

• Developed real-time keyword detection system using PyTorch, implementing 2D CNN models (40K-50K parameters) with MFCC feature extraction, achieving 85%+ training accuracy and exporting to multiple formats (ONNX, TorchScript, ExecuTorch) for edge deployment

• Implemented comprehensive ML pipeline including aggressive data augmentation, automated class imbalance handling with weighted focal loss, sliding window inference for false-positive reduction, and interactive GUI for real-time visualization and testing

## My Recommendation (Best for Software/ML Engineer Resume):

**Option 1** - It highlights:
- Technical depth (PyTorch, 2D CNN, edge optimization)
- Measurable results (70-85% accuracy, <2MB models)
- Real-world application (ESP32 deployment)
- Problem-solving (class imbalance, data augmentation)

**Option 2** - If you want to emphasize:
- Full-stack ML development (end-to-end pipeline)
- User-facing deliverables (GUI/CLI)
- Performance optimization (latency, model size)
